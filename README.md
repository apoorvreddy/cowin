# cowin

This is a sample script to try out the cowin APIs. The APIs are public - https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin/cowin-public-v2

You can configure the pincode and your mobile number, and the script will tell you if there's any center having vaccination slots for people below 45. I tried a few pincodes but could not find any. 

Run the script as ```python3 cowin.py```
